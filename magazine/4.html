		<h1><div>What John Rance Had to Tell</div></h1>
	  <div class="content" class="chapter">
  	  <p>It was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.</p> 
      <p>"There is nothing like first-hand evidence," he remarked; "as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned."</p> 
      <p>"You amaze me, Holmes," said I. "Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave."</p> 
      <p>"There's no room for a mistake," he answered. "The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning&mdash;I have Gregson's word for that&mdash;it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house."</p>
